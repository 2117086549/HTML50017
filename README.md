_.o0 Psiral 0o._
==========================

HTML5/Javascript web browser game. GitHub [game-off-2013](https://github.com/github/game-off-2013) challenge entry.

What we want to do here is to create a turn based strategy game in which four wizards battle to reach the fountain of endless energy.This, of course, will bring them eternity and power beyond human imagination. Each wizard controls the powers of one of the four known elements - earth, water, fire and woodâ€¦ uhm, I mean air. So, which one will get there first? Choose and find out.

## To be continued ...

We couldn't really finish this game in time. Four weeks were (as expected) not enough to complete Psiral. 
We do, howerver, plan to continue working on this title after Game-Off 2013. We have on our *TODO* list more graphics 
and animations to add, improved AI with learning capabilities, coop. and network play and much more. 
So, stick around if you're interested in the Psiral saga. 

See you soon! ;)
